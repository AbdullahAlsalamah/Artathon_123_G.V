# Artathon_123_G.V

This repository includes a Style Transfer Neural Network. The aim of the model is to produce a piece of art by applying several styles on an image.
The model works as the following. It is presented with an art image with some style and a normal image (e.g., a photo of a building). Then, it applies the style on the photo. So, the result is an artwork composing of the content of the photo and the applied style. The model is built by utilizing intermediate layers of a pre-trained VGG16 network because these layers capture high level features (e.g., objects).
